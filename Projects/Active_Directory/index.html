                    <p>
                        The goal of this project is to demonstrate my abilities to set up and configure a network in a virtual laboratory setting and practice using industry standard tools. I will also simulate an attack on this network using readily available tools and techniques.

                        If successful the network will be configured exactly like the below diagram and feature the following:

                            Step One: Install and configure the Virtual Machines
                        </h4>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The plan is to have all of the VMs running on a single computer. I have a Windows 10 machine with 32 gigs of ram and this will handle everything without problems. The first step was to download and install all four operation systems on the VirtualBox. The OS were downloaded from there respective sites one at a time. They were all assigned 4 gigabytes of ram and 50 gigabytes of file space except the Ubuntu machine it was given 8 gigabytes ram and 100 gigabytes disk space to give it a little more power for running queries. I already had VirtualBox and baseline Kali Linux instances running on my machine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I created a NAT Network on VirtualBox and connected all of the VMs to this network.I named the network AD-Project and set the IPv4 Prefix to 192.168.10.0/24. Before moving to the next step I created a snapshot of each OS instance and named it "Setup Baseline".

                    <p>
                        <h4>Step Two: Setup Splunk Server</h4>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I edited the 00-installer-config.yaml to reflect the desired state of the machine and set the static IP to 192.168.10.10. On the Ubuntu version I deployed I was not able to directly apply netplan until I installed openvswitch-switch-dpdk firsts.
                    </p>
                    <img src="assets\images\00-installer-config.png" alt="Installer Config">
                    <p>
                        The Splunk Enterprise for Linux was downloaded on the parent machine so I needed to install virtualbox-guest-additions-iso, and virtualbox-guest-utils in order to mount a shared drive between the VM parent and the Ubuntu instance. I also needed to set up the share in VirtualBox and point it to the directory containing the download. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Splunk Enterprise was installed from the shared directory and the default Splunk user was created. I enabled Splunk to run on startup via "sudo ./splunk enable boot-start -user splunk". Splunk was now running on the Ubuntu server and the dashboard is reachable via the browser at 192.168.10.10:8000 although no data was currently flowing to it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h4>Step Three: Add Splunk Universal Forwarder to the Domain Controller and the Windows 10 machine.</h4>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The setup process for both the Window Server 2022 and the Windows 10 Pro machine were the same. Splunk Universal Forwarder was downloaded and installed from the Splunk website and installed normally and configured to send logs to 192.168.10.10:9997. Sysmon was downloaded from a Microsoft page from a google search. I also used a configuration for sysmon that was posted on a GitHub users page (this was recommended by a youtuber). Sysmon was installed using PowerShell and the configuration .XML file. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once both devices were set up with the forwarder and sysmon was configured I was able to see telemetry data flowing to the Splunk server. The Splunk server need to be set up to look for inputs on the "endpoint" and after that searches for "index=endpoint" showed data coming from 2 different hosts (Windows Server and Windows 10). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h4>Step Four: Installing Active Directory</h4>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the server computer I installed and configured Active Director via Server Manager -> Manage -> Add Roles and Features. I created the domain ANDY.LOCAL and added to organizational units (IT and HR). I then created two fictional users (Teri Smith to HR and Jenny Smith to IT) and assigned them to the org units. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once the server was set up I went to the Windows 10 instance and joined the newly created domain. I changed the network settings to reflect the desired state pointing to 192.168.10.7 as the DNS and logged in with one of the fictional user accounts. From here I was able to test that I had access to the network and that i could ping the splunk server.

                    <img src="assets\images\Win10_Target_IP.png" alt="Windows 10 Network Setup">
                    <p>
                        In preparation for the next step I prepared the Windows 10 PC for the attack phase by enabling a service that is disabled by default. I enabled remote desktop on the target machine and left it running and signed in. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h4>Step Five: Attack Target PC</h4>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From the Kali Linux VM I installed crowbar and unzipped the passwords file bundled with the package. I edited the password file to include the actual password I set on the fictional user account for purposes of this test so that I would for sure get a positive result. Crowbar attempted to sign in on port 3389 to the rdp service using the account name and IP address I provided using every password in the password file. 
                    </p>
                    <img src="assets\images\kali-crowbar-success.png" alt="Crowbar successful attack">
                    <p>
                        This demonstrates a weakness in the Remote Desktop Protocol to dictionary attacks. If EDP in enabled and the attacker is able to obtain a valid user name in Active Directory they could launch a dictionary attack they may be successful if strong passwords are not enforced. After this "attack" I was able to see in Splunk evidence of a number of almost simultaneous failed login attempts followed by a successful attempt all attributed to a IP address that would not be a part of a authorized list. Failed attempts showed as EventCode 4625 (An account failed to log on) This type of activity may alert a system monitor to suspicious activity from this user and could trigger action to block the IP at the firewall.

                    <p>
                        On the target system I also installed AtomicRedTeam via Powershell. Once installed I was able to run Atomic 1136.001 "Persistence Create Account - Local Account" and successfully able to create an account. I also ran 1059.001 "Command and Scripting Interpreter - PowerShell" and  failed due to lack of access. These "attacks" are directly linked to common attack types from the MITRE ATT&CK framework and demonstrate vulnerability (in the case of 1136.001) to the default configuration. If an attacked gain access to an active directory account they would be able to move laterally into a new account to gain persistence in the network.

                    <p>
                        <b>Summary:</b> For this project I was able to successful deploy and configure four different operating systems on a simulated network. Each device was setup according to it's role in the exercise and they all functioned properly based on the plan. I was able to deploy an instance of Splunk in the simulation and pass telemetry to the service from two different network devices. Active Directory was installed on the domain controller and user accounts were created. The target endpoint was able to join the domain and act like an regular user with limited permissions. Once configured I was able to launch a couple of different attacks on the network using available tools and techniques. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Working through this material was very rewarding for me. I was able to use a few tools that I have limited experience with (Splunk, and Active Directory) as well as increase my skills with others I am more familiar with(Linux, VirtualBox). I was also able to see how easily attacks against a network can happen when systems are not configured properly and know vulnerabilities are not accounted for. 
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        The most rewarding aspect of this was definitely seeing the direct relationship between the input and output with an industry standard SIEM tool. I was able to launch an attack and then immediately login to Splunk to see what the logs looked like. This was a valuable experience for me and I am sure to expand on this foundation and I continue to practice and study these common techniques.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Next Steps:</b> Now that I have a fully functional network with active directory and Splunk installed I can experiment with other configurations and processes. I will also be able to test other vulnerabilities and learn how to harden the network against them. Active Directory is very common in corporate networks so I will also experiment with methods of managing users and organizational units including ways to automate and test the process. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Conclusion:</b> Overall a successful and entertaining experience. Lots of really cool tools and techniques demonstrated through the process. I am very grateful for the opportunity and thankful to this YouTuber for putting it together for me!
