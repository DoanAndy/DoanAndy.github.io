                    <h3>Goal</h3>
                    <p>
                        The goal of this project is to demonstrate my abilities to set up and configure a network in a virtual laboratory setting and practice using industry standard tools. I will also simulate an attack on this network using readily available tools and techniques.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If successful the network will be configured exactly like the below diagram and feature the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Windows Server 2022 with a static IP, Active Directory enabled, Splunk Universal Forwarder and Sysmon installed

                                Ubuntu Server with a static IP and Splunk Server installed

                    <p>
                        <b>Summary:</b> For this project I was able to successful deploy and configure four different operating systems on a simulated network. Each device was setup according to it's role in the exercise and they all functioned properly based on the plan. I was able to deploy an instance of Splunk in the simulation and pass telemetry to the service from two different network devices. Active Directory was installed on the domain controller and user accounts were created. The target endpoint was able to join the domain and act like an regular user with limited permissions. Once configured I was able to launch a couple of different attacks on the network using available tools and techniques. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Working through this material was very rewarding for me. I was able to use a few tools that I have limited experience with (Splunk, and Active Directory) as well as increase my skills with others I am more familiar with(Linux, VirtualBox). I was also able to see how easily attacks against a network can happen when systems are not configured properly and know vulnerabilities are not accounted for. 
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        The most rewarding aspect of this was definitely seeing the direct relationship between the input and output with an industry standard SIEM tool. I was able to launch an attack and then immediately login to Splunk to see what the logs looked like. This was a valuable experience for me and I am sure to expand on this foundation and I continue to practice and study these common techniques.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Conclusion:</b> Overall a successful and entertaining experience. Lots of really cool tools and techniques demonstrated through the process. I am very grateful for the opportunity and thankful to this YouTuber for putting it together for me!
