Custom SQL Query

Situation
Internal metrics showed that ONTO stations would routinely miss contingency assignment goals
Direct inject wayfair trailers were not always accounted for on sort submissions
Causing lack of visibility and mis sorting of LPs
Packages from this shipper were not always showing up on due date (before and after)
Grand scheme of things this was a very small problem that impacted 

Task
Improve sort of LPs
Reduce Contingency assignment

Action
Created a custom SQL query that looked for packages processed by account number a due date
created a custom report issued to stakeholders in impacted stations to advise them what dates to include with sort submission
Develop channels of communication to impacted sort personnel

ONTO district was able to attain Contingency goals

Sort Carts Fedex Coordinator

Situation
Freight Make up changed to include increased LP, buildings had narrow passage by the unload doors
Employee Satisfaction decreased frustration increased
Sort duration increased because LPs left till the end

Task
Deal with the reality of the change in volume
Find a way to complete daily tasks without straining employees
Reduce the staff required to move LPs to the line

Action
Looked to examples in other businesses
	Ikea - not comparable because they use flat carts
	Home Depot uses upright carts to move plywood
Slight modification lowered the bar on the one side

Result
Required monitoring but LPs could be moved easliy from the upload to the line

What I would have done differently 
Track employee satisfaction 
	loading and unloading LPs
	Sort duration
Document the process and include the metrics
Roll out to other stations

Route Changes ZAXL

Situation

Task
Reduce the head count and improve productivity

Action
Meeting held with all employees to discuss their motivations and needs
Shared our motivations and needs and expectations
Shared new pay scales and the possibilities and path forward
Introduced alternative schedules and varying pay

Result 
We were able to run with 4 less resources on a regular basis
