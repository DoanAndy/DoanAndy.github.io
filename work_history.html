                In late 2020 I was put in contact with Sunjay Nath via LinkedIn. He was in the process of purchasing an existing FedEx Ground contract and he needed someone to run it for him. Although at the time I was happy with my position at FedEx a lot of what Sunjay presented as his business plan aligned perfectly with my personal values. With my knowledge of FedEx contracts and with the management structure of the new company I felt correctly so that I would thrive in this endeavor. After getting through the start-up phase of the business through the first year the plan was to look aggressively at grow and expand into other geographic areas. Unfortunately, in the summer of 2023 as part of a reorganization plan FedEx made an announcement, they would discontinue all FedEx Ground contracts in Canada as of 2024 and switch to an employee driver model. Although this is not the way I was hoping for this to end I am still happy with my decision, and I am grateful for the opportunities given to me by Sunjay (ZAXL) and FedEx Ground.

              <p>SEPTEMBER 2008 - APRIL 2021</p>
              <p>After moving my family from Ontario to Calgary Alberta I accepted a position with FedEx Ground as operations manager for the preload sort. Over the next thirteen years I changed positions four times and relocated twice (Sudbury,ON - Grimsby, ON). With FedEx I was given many opportunities to grow professionally while at the same time working through operational challenges. I enjoyed my time with the company and believe I would still be there today if not for the opportunity with ZAXL. Below I have listed the different positions held while at FedEx starting with the most recent and working back.</p>
